            <p>I've written and  maintain an open source project that is called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/immutable-treeutils">immutable-treeutils</a>, a small library that enables traversal of nested Immutable.JS trees given a well-defined data structure (~1.5k downloads per month)</p>
            <p>2017 will probably see me releasing <a href="https://github.com/lukasbuenger/immutable-richtext">a very opinionated state-only solution to the contenteditable problem</a> based on:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The inherent misconception that <a href="https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate">Slate</a>, <a href="https://draftjs.org/">Draft.js</a>, <a href="https://github.com/guardian/scribe">Scribe</a> and the likes bring to the news publishing table.
                </li>
                <li>The insights <a href="https://medium.engineering/why-contenteditable-is-terrible-122d8a40e480#.xufbuok9s">that Medium people thankfully shared</a>.

                <li>The experiences that I made working as a tooling guy for a publishing shop for the last 3 years.</li>
